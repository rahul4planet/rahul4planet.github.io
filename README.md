Rahul Kumar: Climate Change and Water Security Scholar
I am Rahul Kumar, a dedicated PhD researcher in Environmental Science at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, specializing in global water security and the impacts of climate change. My academic journey and research career are rooted in the belief that addressing the world's most pressing environmental challenges requires both rigorous science and innovative technology.

With a core expertise in atmospheric sciences, climate modeling (CMIP6), and remote sensing, I utilize advanced tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS, and Google Earth Engine to analyze large-scale climatic and geospatial datasets. My proficiency in R and Python allows me to extract actionable insights from complex data, supporting evidence-based policymaking and sustainable development strategies.

Throughout my career, I have led and contributed to several interdisciplinary research projects, ranging from urban air quality assessment during lockdowns to the evaluation of pesticide impacts on rural agriculture and my ongoing doctoral research on water security under future climate scenarios. My work integrates hydro-climatology, climate data visualization, and spatial analysis, with a strong commitment to translating research into real-world impact.

Driven by curiosity and a passion for technology, I continuously develop my programming and analytical skills, adopting the latest scientific approaches to environmental data analysis. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional environments, bringing adaptability, integrity, and self-motivation to every project.

This portfolio highlights my research, technical competencies, academic recognitions, and ongoing contributions to the field of climate and environmental science. My mission is to advance knowledge and solutions that foster resilience, sustainability, and informed decision-making in the face of global climate challenges.
