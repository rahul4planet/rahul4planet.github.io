I am Rahul Kumar, a PhD researcher specializing in environmental science with a strong focus on global water security and climate change. My expertise spans atmospheric sciences, climate modeling (CMIP6), and remote sensing using tools like ArcGIS, QGIS, and Google Earth Engine. I actively apply R and Python to analyze large-scale climatic and geospatial datasets to derive insights that support sustainable policy and decision-making.

Over the years, I have contributed to several interdisciplinary research projects, including studies on the impact of lockdown on urban air quality, pesticide usage in rural agriculture, and ongoing doctoral research into water security under future climate scenarios. My research interests include hydro-climatology, climate data visualization, and spatial analysis.

With a keen interest in technology, I have developed strong programming and analytical skills, backed by tools like MS Office, advanced Excel, and data visualization platforms. I bring a collaborative, adaptable, and self-driven work ethic, and continuously strive to adopt new tools and scientific approaches to address complex environmental challenges.

This portfolio showcases my research projects, technical skills, recognitions, and contributions to the field of climate and environmental science.
